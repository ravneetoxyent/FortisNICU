		It specifies the time, in milliseconds, to filter out consecutive
		click events. If two click events (including onOK and onCancel) come
		too close (within the specified delay), the second one will be removed
		to avoid the denial-of-service attack. A non-positive value turns off

		It specifies the time, in milliseconds, to wait before resending the
		AU requests to the server. There are many reasons an AU request is not
		received by the server. For example, the server may drop the
		connection if it is overloaded. To ensure the reliability, ZK will
		abort the previous request and then resend the request, if the
		specified delay expires.
